# HONEST AQ

![Logo](/public/img/navbar_logo.png)

The HONEST AQ service promotes awareness of outdoor air pollution and public health and safety by giving users immediate access to the air quality index for the specified city or the closest city. This project uses a database to store user data and a third-party API to retrieve the most recent air quality statistics for the user's closest city.

There are four pages on our website: Home, About, Resources, and Contact. Our application, which automatically displays the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the closest city to where our users are located, is available on our home page. A video and information about the primary causes of air pollution are also included on the homepage to increase awareness of the problem. Our objective, the website's functionality, and the purpose of the AQI are all stated on the About page. The Resources page provides readers with relevant resources they can use to learn more about air pollution as well as information on how air quality impacts the wellbeing of the world and how to prevent air pollution. Users can sign up for Honest AQ tips and news using the form on the last page, the Contact page.
